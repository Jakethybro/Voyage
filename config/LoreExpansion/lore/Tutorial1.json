    I've been through a lot in this last few days. Or wait, maybe weeks. I don't know how long I've been knocked out.
	I might be the luckiest person in the world or the least. I've been held hostage but have escaped. I've been shot but have healed. I am alone, but I am alive.
	Right now I am collecting oak wood to build... something. Wait a second! I could build a tool bench to create more efficient tools.",

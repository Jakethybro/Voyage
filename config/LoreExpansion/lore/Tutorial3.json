	It has to be a person or a spirit. It can physically take my items and creations, and change them to say.. water!
	This is crazy. Wait.. this might just be a dream! Or.. or.. a hallucination! I might just still be on that row boat and going through the sea
	Or I might just.. be in wonderland. I don't know. I just miss back how it was. I miss my old life.. before these stupid pirates held me hostage!
    I should of never gotten that job. I mean... I don't know anymore.. I might just be some fake thing in some fake world or.. I.. I DON'T KNOW!	",
